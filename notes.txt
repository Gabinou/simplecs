INDEPENDENCE FROM stb_ds:
	arrput
	arrdel
	arrsetcap
	arrsetlen
	how to implement the "storing extra data "before" the pointer." trick? NO IDEA DON'T CARE.
		FORGET IT -> store lengths in WORLD. I NEVER USE ARRLEN ALREADY.

TO DO:
	add_component
		-> need component token to add empty components I think.
		
	get_system_order function (DONE?)
	deal with component_arrays (DONE?)
		-> Initialization of empty components
		-> Put component in components_bytype
	set system phase upon system registration
		+ overloaded macro?
	set_system_phase function + associated macro
		-> system_migrate function + associated macro
	get_component_list inside system
		+ entity_order list? Is it really necessary? Maybe just having the components is enough?
	component_remove from entity
