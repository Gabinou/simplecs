TO DO:
	get_system_order function (DONE?)
	deal with component_arrays
		-> Initialization of empty components
		-> Put component in components_bytype
	set system phase upon system registration
		+ overloaded macro?
	set_system_phase function + associated macro
		-> system_migrate function + associated macro
	get_component_list inside system
		+ entity_order list? Is it really necessary? Maybe just having the components is enough?
