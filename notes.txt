Arrays are much faster than hash tables.

TO DO:
	RENAME MACROS/FUNCTIONS/EVERYTHING

	set system phase upon system registration (DONE?)
		+ overloaded macro?
	set_system_phase function + associated macro
		-> system_migrate function + associated macro

	get_component_list inside system
		+ entity_order list? Is it really necessary? Maybe just having the components is enough?

	component_remove from entity 

	World Progress. DONE BUT HOW TO NAME IT?
		-> Input time since last frame
		-> measure frame time anyway -> unless input non->zero.

	World destruction	

DONE:
	INDEPENDENCE FROM stb_ds!
	
	deal with component_arrays
		-> Initialization of empty components
		-> Put component in components_bytype

	add_component
		-> need component token to add empty components I think.
